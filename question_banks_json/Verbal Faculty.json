Contemporary discourse, however, often seeks to eliminate suffering</p><p>entirely through technological, medical, and psychological means. While such</p><p>efforts are ethically motivated, some critics argue that this pursuit creates a</p><p>paradox: by shielding individuals from adversity, society may inadvertently</p><p>diminish resilience, empathy, and perspective. Moreover, sanitized</p><p>environments—physical and emotional—may leave people ill-equipped to process grief, failure, or discomfort. Supporters of mitigation counter that no moral justification can outweigh the duty to reduce avoidable pain, and that growth does not necessitate trauma. The debate persists, revealing deep tensions between compassion and the unintended consequences of overprotection.</p>",
